# 🖥️ Shellscape

**Shellscape** is an interactive, terminal-based cybersecurity training platform that simulates real-world penetration testing scenarios inside a browser.

Instead of learning tools passively, users actively **solve challenges using real commands** like `nmap`, `grep`, `curl`, `john`, and more — just like in actual CTFs and pentests.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 **Learn by Doing** — Solve hands-on challenges instead of reading theory
- 🖥️ **Fully Terminal-Based UI** — No buttons, no shortcuts — just commands
- 🔐 **Real-World Tools Simulation**:
  - Linux: `ls`, `cd`, `grep`, `find`, `env`
  - Network: `nmap`, `netstat`, `whois`, `dig`
  - Crypto: `base64`, `rot13`, `john`, `xor`
  - Web: `curl`, `gobuster`, `cookies`
  - Forensics: `file`, `strings`, `exif`

- 🎯 **Progressive Levels** — Each level teaches a real-world concept
- 🧩 **5 Tracks, 26 Levels**:
  - 🐧 Linux (8 levels)
  - 🌐 Network (6 levels)
  - 🔐 Crypto (7 levels)
  - 🕸 Web (5 levels)
  - 🔍 Forensics (5 levels)

- 📊 **Progress Tracking System**
- ⚡ **Command Autocomplete + History**

## 🎮 How It Works

You start in a simulated shell:

```
guest@shellscape:~$
```

From there:

1. Connect to a level:

   ```bash
   ssh level0@linux
   ```

2. Read the objective

3. Use commands to explore the environment

4. Find the password

5. Move to the next level

Everything happens inside the terminal — including authentication.

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy

Shellscape is built on a simple idea:

> "You don’t learn cybersecurity by watching — you learn by breaking things."

Each level is designed around:

- Real misconfigurations
- Common vulnerabilities
- Actual attacker workflows

Examples:

- Finding credentials in `.env` files
- Exploiting exposed `robots.txt`
- Cracking MD5 hashes with wordlists
- Discovering services via `nmap`
- Extracting secrets from binaries using `strings`

## 🏗️ Project Structure

All files are in a single directory for simplicity:

```
Shellscape/
│
├── index.html      # Main entry point (terminal UI)
├── style.css       # Terminal styling
├── engine.js       # Core game logic (levels, SSH, progress)
├── terminal.js     # Terminal behavior & input handling
├── commands.js     # All command implementations
├── levels.js       # Level data and scenarios
└── README.md
```

### 🔧 Core Components

- **engine.js** → Handles level switching, SSH simulation, and progress tracking
- **commands.js** → Implements all terminal commands (Linux, Network, Crypto, Web, Forensics)
- **levels.js** → Stores all levels, files, and challenge data
- **terminal.js** → Manages UI behavior, cursor, input, and history
- **style.css** → Defines the terminal look and feel
- **index.html** → Loads everything and acts as the main interface
